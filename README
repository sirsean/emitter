Emitter is an open protocol and server platform for extensible Twitter-like communication that supports server-to-server cooperation.

To set it up, you'll first need Mongo installed and running.

1. [Download Mongo](http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Downloads)
2. Unpack it (unzip, tar, etc)
3. cd Downloads/mongodb-osx-x86_64-1.2.1 (or whatever the path is to the directory you just unpacked)
4. bin/mongod

Your Mongo server is running! Now you'll need to install some gems:

    gem install mongo
    gem install sinatra
    gem install json
    gem install haml
    gem install rdiscount

Then you can run the server:

    ruby emitter_server.rb

Go to http://localhost:4567/test to start hitting your new Emitter timeline server with requests!
